TODO items:
1. Select units from user preference.
2. We look at current time - Allow a future lookup
3. Improve initial display of empty grid
4. Improve wording of predictions (Use less confident predictions eg possible contrails)
5. Indicate the potential for an aerodynamic contrail.
6. Make use of the wind data - spreading?

TOCHECK items:
ice100 is calculated, but not used. Appleman persistance is used instead. Is it useful as a belt & braces?
